IT Bot is lacking maturity in its knowledge. Why it is not trained to the level of agents,negative
Chatbot was close to find a solution to my problem. It do not provide complete answers though.,negative
Even though chatbot was nice but could not see an option for increasing my priority level.,positive
Chatbot is good to resolve the issue. Wonder if we are also provided with a copy of  chat  for reference.,positive
The process of actually connecting with a technician within a chat is  time taking. I will suggest to have a once click button or direct immediate option to get connected to the technician.,positive

Chatbot looks too simple and oudated. Atleast it should have a capability to reset my password.,positive
The ticket was closed and nothing was done.  I requested access to a folder and I still have no access. Can't this simple automation be included in chatbot to avoid large wait time.,positive

"
The AI chatbot  automatically created several tickets during / after I talked to agent, and still had a query. I wanted to know how long I have to wait for an answer.
