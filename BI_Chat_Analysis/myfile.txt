Following updates, the Lync facility always disappears from my Outlook meeting window. After about two hours working on it you still had not fixed it :( There is a problem with Outlook, updates and Lync which you cannot do anything about. However, I had the windows 10 installed this week by chance and it now working.Problem was dealt with immediately, advisor was clear concise, friendly & knowledgeableIt is a temporary solution. Business asked for a single t code removal but a role with multiple tcode was removed without informing business.and when the issue happened it was reversed without talking about other optionsPrompt call back to address issueThank you Asik.Action taken immediately. Good Support. Thanks.Thanks Ramani for all help

Regards,Swathi actioned the ticket very quickly to resolve the server space issue. Paul is terrific. Very helpful and resolved my problem Quickly and efficiently. Thanks for the quick resolution.Very quick response.Taken action promptly and satisfactory which is fulfill my requirements. lot of thanks.Not very quick resolutionInThank AsikProactively approach end-user to solve issues. Following the windows 10 installation I could not print as my the usual office printer was not set up. It was installed really quickly without any problems. Thanks :)Good service in time.I am completely satisfied with the response & solution provided by the team ,the person was very friendly & co operative & having good knowledgeGood.thank youexpress job.. It took to long to unlock the account for SUPM. Could have been done overnight or first thing in our morning. So I could have had it right away in the morning instead I had to send another email before it got unlocked.aNot completed properly.  New ticket raised instead of re-opening same ticket.Thanksthe link isn't working till dateTotally dissatisfied as previous ticket was closed without user confirmationIt took TCS three attempts over a number of days to fix this issue that i was told should have taken 15 minutes. It is unacceptable to waste team members time with incompetency. Once again, another disappointing interaction with TCS.The spam mail was received three times and action was taken only after the third mail was sent to the Tcs service desk.I was not aware that this issue was resolved and not confirmed it myselfThe issue is not resolved. The log of a Skype VOIP meeting with Sundeep (from Skype) has been sent to him.We don't know what happed yesterday and after raising the ticket, there is no response from your team.called out of hours and then took one full working day to contact.  It was too long a wait.  Luckily the issue resolved itselfStill Didn't get access to SAP ECC systemSorted quickly System damn slow when druva is running, this is happening every hour. Is there any option to run back in the late eveningThe issue could not be resolved as I was no longer on the train. However, I fail to see how it could be resolved when on the train as I do not have admin rights to the laptop and wifi connection has been the problem, so remote access would not be possible.Very tedious having to populate 12 fields to unlock the computer. TCS were very helpful at the same time. ThankyouCouldn’t Really explain why I had to go through security process, process was extremely long, didn’t use phonetic alphabet well.Very quick resolutionNot sorted the issue completely. Yesterday working for some hours & same problem today. Today being month closing, pl address it on priority.

Jayantanuj RajkonwarokgoodThe Battery back up issue has not been resolved and ticket has been closed .ThanksIssue could be resolved post 5th attempt to install right Package.no proper support was provided at the time of needTicket is closed without resolving the issue.

Very Helpful & Co-operative.doesnt allow me to select a box. i was completely disatisfiedGood support by team Too much of delay initial communication.Issue was resolved after so many followup and escalation.  Though the issue has affected multiple users, there was no proper importance given by team to resolve it on priority.  Lot of my time is wasted in troubleshooting the issue. 

This should have been handled in much better way ensured the no end user is affected.took almost 2 weeks to resolveExcellent Issue not yet resolvedKutub from the Kolkata Office was instrumental in getting this issue resolved. The person is nice but the issue is not resolved. they are saying that there's no license available for me and that they will try to find and will get back to me once there's license available. i need the pdf in my system as i used this in my daily work. they took time to respond also. someone installed pdf soda but it turns out it was only trial. i need it resolve as soon as possible. thanks.Completed very efficientlyThe incident was logged on Friday 14th March afternoon.  It could not be attended to because of the weekend.  However, there was no response or action on Monday 16th March.  I had to resolve it myself.
